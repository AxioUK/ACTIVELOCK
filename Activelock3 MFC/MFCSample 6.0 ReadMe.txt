MFCSample VC 6.0

This was developed backwards, that is it existed for VS 2003 and not for VC 6.0 and I did
not want to spend too much time on it.

Sorted out some problems I had earlier with include files, this now uses the same source files as 
the VS2003 version

Otherwise this is effectively the same as the VS 2003 and uses the same set of activelock
source code in common/active/
