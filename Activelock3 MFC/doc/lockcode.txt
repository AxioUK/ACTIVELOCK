
I am forever making a mess of LockCode, but I will perceiver.
Last time I said that my code 'orderd' enumerations which was a stupid idea,
as a solution I suggested using a long to store the 'orderd' enumerations in
this solved the initial problem but if you have a lot of lock codes
orderd together they need to be separated
Therefore they should not be ordered together but stored in an array/collection
My latest attempt does this ( 2 failures, next time correct, --Maybe--)

Also 
1. The array is built directly into mUsedLockTypes, not into a temporary version and copied later.
2. If LockNone has been selected then LockNone is the first entry in the array,
but is now followed by the individual LockCodes that have been used.
3. Private Property Let IActiveLock_UsedLockType has been removed
4. Private Property Get IActiveLock_UsedLockType() As ALLockTypes()
   Now returns an array

I am forwarding the code to Ismail in a private email
I am not a VB programmer and the new code contains the use of arrays which requires checking
and general inspection.
I have done some simple testing.
