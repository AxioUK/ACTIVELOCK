This readme is intended for updating and verifying the XML Doc Comments, available
in VS2005 and up, in the activelock code to help new users of activelock through
the IDE's Intellisense features.

Please use XML Doc Comments where-ever possible when adding/updating code.  This
will help minimize some frequently asked questions on the forums, as well as assist
in making html help files when completed.

I have added several blank templates to the code, and where-ever possible, I
added/updated/converted the existing comments.  At least 1/4 of the code can
now display help in the Object Browser and through Intellisense.

I left the original comments intact until the documentation process is completed
and verified, at which point it should be cleaned up.

To learn more about XML Doc Comments please see the following MSDN link:

Thank you for your time!
