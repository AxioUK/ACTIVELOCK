This project was converted from VB to C# using SharpDevelop A Free IDE for Several
languages!  There are alot of errors in the C# code, and the comments I made are
all misplaced!

The interfaces are a little messed up so don't expect much!  The conversion handled
most of the code, but it's not perfect, it should be inspected completly by someone
who knows the code!

I have not modified the DLL Base addres or GUID, I just imported the cs files that
were converted into and empty project!

I hope there is much help with this!
